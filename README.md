# Hi, my name is Seb

I have only recently gotten into programming and would like to learn much more.

## I currently know:
    Python
    C++
    Html/CSS

I started from CS50x

I am interested in learning much more in terms of programming. I am also interested in the fields of linguistics and creative writing. Aswell as creating my own worlds and languages (spoken, not programming, although they would still be fun) for these worlds
